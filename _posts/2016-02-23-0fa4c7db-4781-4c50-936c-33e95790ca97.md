Tech Support Scammers Lure Users With Fake Norton Warnings, Turn Out To Be Symantec Reseller
![](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norton_scam-965x395.png)

Fraudulent tech support companies are well-known for taking advantage of unsavvy computer users by reeling them in with scare tactics and charging large amounts of money for bogus services.
In many cases, these crooks sell free security products (or straight up pirate them) for hundreds of dollars more than their actual retail price. Security vendors may not be aware of these practices let alone what kind of sales pitch scammers use to force those sales.
In one of the worst cases of abuse we have seen so far, a company that happens to be an active member of the Symantec Partner Program is scamming people with fake warnings designed to look like Symantec's flagship product, Norton Antivirus. 

The alert message is displayed via a web page hosted on quicklogin.us/norton and urges users to call for support immediately saying: "System Critically Infected. If you are not able to click on this button, Immediately contact Support toll Free Helpline 1-855-637-1900"
