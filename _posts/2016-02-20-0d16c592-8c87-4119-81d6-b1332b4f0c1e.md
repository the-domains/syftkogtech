Student debt protests planned after armed marshals arrest man for old loans
The US marshals' office plans to serve more than 1,200 warrants for unpaid student loans as for-profit college students deman

<article style=""><h1>Student debt protests planned after armed marshals arrest man for old loans</h1><p>Seven US marshals armed with automatic weapons turned up at Paul Aker's home in Houston&amp;comma; Texas&amp;comma; last week to arrest him over a &amp;dollar;1&amp;comma;500 student loan debt dating back to 1987&amp;period; "It was totally mind-boggling&amp;comma;" Aker said&amp;period; "I was wondering&amp;comma; why are you here&amp;quest; I am home&amp;comma; I haven't done anything &amp;period;&amp;period;&amp;period;</p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fd9434c00e0b590ac102342afef65b8e4840f86/0_22_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=cde2ba49ac1c05c1a32efae1523172d1" /></article>

"It was totally mind-boggling," Aker said. "I was wondering, why are you here? I am home, I haven't done anything ... Why are the marshals knocking on my door? It's amazing."
Aker said he was arrested, shackled and taken to federal court. "I was told: 'You owe $1,500.' I just couldn't believe it," he told Fox 26\. "I was taken before a judge surrounded by seven marshals."
Texas representative Gene Green, a Democrat, said it was unacceptable that US marshals are being used to collect decades old student loans. "There's bound to be a better way to collect on a student loan debt that is so old," he told the station.
Aker is unlikely to be the only person to be surprised by marshals collecting on student loans. A source at the marshal's office told Fox 26 that it is planning to serve warrants on 1,200 to 1,500 people over student loan debts.
